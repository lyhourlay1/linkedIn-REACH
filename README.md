Overview: This is a mastermind game that is built using React and random integer api. 
React provides a powerful tool that allows auto rendering as well as the power to
update only the necessary nodes. React uses virtual DOM to avoid re-rendering the
whole tree. Game functionalities include keydown event listener to allow users to 
type their guess. The random integer api was used to generate a random 4 digits 
number. Additional interface features like restart and game result display when users 
lost or won are included to create a great user experience and interface. The goal
of the game is to have users making educated guess based of the hints that are 
provided from each guess. Each game, a user has 10 tries to guess the right number.
